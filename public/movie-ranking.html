<h2>The Top 3 Movies of 2023</h2>

<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>
    <p>RRR Set in 1920s India, the plot, as it is, pits soldier Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and villager Komaram Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr) against the British Empire, represented by Governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson, terrible) and his even more vindictive wife Catherine (Alison Doody, who wields a particularly nasty whip as a reminder of her Indiana Jones days), after the Brits kidnap Bheem’s kid sister. Raju and Bheem are introduced in fantastic fashion — the former performing an in-camera version of The Matrix Reloaded’s ‘burly brawl’ to apprehend a wrong’un, the latter outrunning a wolf and then shouting down a tiger — and then come together to save a little boy in a river on fire (don’t ask) using a motorcycle, a horse, a rope and a ridiculous feat of timing that puts Spider-Man bridge-rescues to shame. This is all in the first half hour.</p>

<h3>Salaar</h3>
<p>
    Salaar: Part 1  Ceasefire, directed by Prashanth Neel, unfolds in the rustic and politically charged landscape of Khansar. This action-packed film, featuring Prabhas as Deva and Prithviraj Sukumaran as Vardharaja, is set against a backdrop of intrigue and rebellion, relying heavily on drama as well as swag and action. Prashanth has meticulously created the dystopian city of Khansar with intricate details, establishing a multitude of characters with a narrative spanning between 1747 and the present times. Reminiscent of Black Panther, the empire boasts 101 tribes with distinct characteristics, divided into three divisions, including Kaparlu (clan leaders) and Doralu (council members).

<h3>Leo</h3>
<p>
    Parthiban (Vijay) lives in a snow globe world, which consists of his wife Sathya (Trisha) and two children. A slight crack lets in some air into his perfect world and what follows is a cyclone that completely shatters the globe. Can Parthiban save his family and rebuild the picture-perfect snow globe?
    Brothers Anthony Das (Sanjay Dutt) and Harold Das (Arjun Sarja) run a tobacco business as a front to their illegal drug business. Anthony’s son, Leo (Vijay) is one of the most powerful ground workers who ensures smooth running of drugs from one place to another. A harrowing incident causes fire in the tobacco factory, thus killing Leo. Cut to 20 years later, the Das brothers find out about Parthiban and his uncanny resemblance to Leo. Did Leo fake his own death to become Parthiban or are they two different people who simply look alike, is what forms the crux of the story
